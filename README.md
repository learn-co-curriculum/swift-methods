## Outline

  * We've been using functions, now let's call them ourselves
  * Go back to your calculateTax function from before
  * new function that's already created called `calculateTotal`
  * adds in a bucnh of items, and then calls calculateTax
  * remember no method arguments yet! so all hard coded
  * Define your own method that calculates Tips
  * Explain the three parts of a method definition, return type, function name,
    arguments
  * We'll go over arguments another day
  * Call the calcualte tip method as well from the calculatetotal method
